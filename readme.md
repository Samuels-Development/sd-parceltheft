# sd-parceltheft

`sd-parceltheft` is a straightforward script that lets players steal parcels from houses and open them for random rewards. Parcels are synced globally, with taken parcels respawning after a set time. The script includes 23 default locations, with easy customization to add more. Props dynamically spawn and despawn based on player proximity.
