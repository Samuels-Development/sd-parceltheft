# sd-parceltheft

`sd-parceltheft` is a straightforward script that lets players steal parcels from houses and open them for random rewards. Parcels are synced globally, with taken parcels respawning after a set time. The script includes 23 default locations, with easy customization to add more. Props dynamically spawn and despawn based on player proximity.

## ðŸ“¦ Item
Add an item called 'parcel' to your inventory or framework.

If you're using `qb-core`, add it in `qb-core/shared/items.lua`.<br>
If you're using `es_extended`, add it to the items table in your database (or whatever it is that ESX users do lol)

In the case of `ox_inventory`, add the following to the items.lua:
```lua
	["parcel"] = {
		label = "Parcel",
		weight = 350,
		stack = false,
		close = true,
		consume = 0,
		description = "Small package filled with something.",
		client = {
			image = "parcel.png",
		},
		server = {
			export = 'sd-parceltheft.useParcel'
		}
	},
```
